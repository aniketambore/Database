		So it's a Database type program the frontend is written with Tkinter and backened is written with SQL.
Basically it's a kind of Note adding program.
I've made this program for my mom.
The label you see in the program is a type of entires which was appropriate for my mom notes.
You can manipulate that or add your own as per your requirement.
I've used a datetime function there just to remember the exact date and time when the entry has made.
So that's the code.
If you find any type of bug there or for any kind of help feel free to message.
